    "# Introduction: Feature Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature preprocessing refers to the general process of preparing a dataset for machine learning. The features (also known as predictors, explanatory variables, or inputs) to a machine learning model must be in a single data structure where each row contains one observation and the columns are the features. The feature values in this data structure (here we will be using a `dataframe`) must all be numbers and there must be no missing values. In a supervised learning task, we have two sets of features, a training set and a testing set. The training set is provided by the model during training along with the targets (the values we want to predict) so the model can learn a mapping between these features and the target. During testing, the model makes predictions on data points (observations) it has not seen before which can be compared to the test labels to determine the model performance. The result of feature preprocessing is a set of training features and a set of testing features that can be for model training and prediction. Feature preprocessing encompasses two processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Feature engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering) (also called feature construction): building new features out of the existing data. This can take on many forms such as extracting the month from a datetime, adding interaction terms between two variables, or taking the natural log transform of a column. Feature engineering adds additional features designed to help the model learn the mapping from features to the target. [This is a crucial step](https://www.featurelabs.com/blog/secret-to-data-science-success/) in machine learning because a model can only learn from the data we provide to it during training.\n",
    "* Feature selection (also called dimensionality reduction): reducing the number of features by selecting those that are \"most relevant\" for a task. The definition pf relevance will depend on the task, but the basic idea of feature selection is to remove redundant or irrelevant variables. Having too many features makes it more difficult for a model to learn, a problem known as the [\"curse of dimensionality.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) The number of data points needed for a model to learn scales exponentially with the number of features, and selecting the most relevant can significantly improve training and generalization performance on the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk through feature preprocessing for the building energy prediction problem. We will focus on feature engineering and extracting as much information as possible from the existing data. As we will see, the number of features, even after feature construction, is not large compared to the number of observations, so we will not perform feature selection (later we can work on feature selection using measures such as feature importance or the variance of a feature). \n",
    "\n",
    "The building energy prediction problem is a supervised regression task. We are given a dataset of past energy use and weather conditions and will build a model that can learn to predict energy consumption. We have the targets - the energy consumption - and during training our model learns a mapping from the features to the target. Then, during testing, we have the model make predictions on new observations it has not previously seen which we can compare to the known testing targets to assess performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will first go through the preprocessing steps one at a time, and then [refactor all of the code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) into a single function that can be re-used in future work. "

    "## Cyclical Variable Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "[Time variables are inherently cyclical](https://ianlondon.github.io/blog/encoding-cyclical-features-24hour-time/) and a typical ordered representation of time does not capture the actual relationship between different times. For example, using hours on a 1-24 scale means that hour 22 is represented as being closer to hour 10 (a 12 hour difference) than to hour 0 (a 22 hour difference). However, behavior at hour 0 is most likely closer to that at hour 22 because the actual time difference is 2 hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "[In order to properly represent cyclical continuous variables](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/5990/what-is-a-good-way-to-transform-cyclic-ordinal-attributes), we need to transform these features into sinusoids by taking the sine and cosine of the variable using the appropriate period. For the hour example, the equations are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{hour sine} = \\text{sin}(\\frac{2 * \\pi * \\text{hour}}{24})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{hour cosine} = \\text{cos}(\\frac{2 * \\pi * \\text{hour}}{24})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to include both the sine and cosine transformations in order to break the symmetry from using only a single sinusoid. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are four time variables that are cyclical and need to be transformed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `yday`: day of the year, period = 365\n",
    "* `month`: month of the year, perdiod = 12\n",
    "* `wday`: day of the week, period = 6 (this variable goes from 0 to 6)\n",
    "* `num_time`: time of the day, period = 24\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the proper period in the code, we can divide by the maximum value in the data. This handles the edge cases where we have datasets that do not have all 12 months or days of the year up to 365. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's show one example of cyclical variable transformations using `num_time`, the time of day in hours. First we can plot the variable in its standard representation."

When categorical variables are strings, they represent an issue for machine learning models and must be converted to a numerical representation. This process of converting categorical string variables to numbers is known as encoding and can be done in two ways:\n",

Each observation will have a 1 in the column corresponding to the value it has for the categorical variable and a 0 in all the other newly formed columns.\n",
    "* [Label encoding](https://chrisalbon.com/machine_learning/preprocessing_structured_data/convert_pandas_categorical_column_into_integers_for_scikit-learn/): map each unique category in a categorical variable to a unique integet. This does not create any new columns.\n",

    "[One hot encoding is generally considered the safer option for encoding categorical variables](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/9443/when-to-use-one-hot-encoding-vs-labelencoder-vs-dictvectorizor) with more than 2 categories. The problem with label encoding is it assigns arbitrary numeric values to categories. For example, the label encoding mapped `manager` to 0 and `teacher` to 2 even though there is no inherent relationship suggesting this ordering of the variable `occupation`. Models such as linear regression apply different weights to features, and assigning an arbitrary numeric values to categorical variables is therefore not conducive to the model learning the correct weights to assign the variable. One hot encoding avoids this issue although it can create a [dimensionality issue](https://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-ki/rojas_home/documents/tutorials/dimensionality.pdf) for variables with many categories. \n",

    "The target we will predict for this problem is __elec_cons__. The `elec_cons` column represents the ground truth observation, and since we want to be able to predict the energy consumption from only the past data, we must use the data we are originally given. Any of the columns computed after getting the data cannot be used for learning. In order to remove incorrect data points, we will keep only observations where the electricity use is greater than 0 because we know electricity consumption must be non-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will extract the targets into a numpy one-dimensional array (it's not strictly necessary to convert to a numpy 1-D array, but some models will throw a warning if this is not done). We can then drop the targets from the data as well as the columns `elec_cons_imp`, `pow_dem`, `anom_flag`, `anom_missed_flag`, `cleaned_energy`, and `forecast`. The rest of the weather and time variables are valid for learning. We will include a check in the column removal step for those dataframes that do not have a `forecast` column."

    "## Feature Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "[Feature scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling) is the process of changing the range of a feature. [This is necessary](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/preprocessing/plot_scaling_importance.html) beause variables are measure in different units and can have significantly different ranges (for example `ghi` can be in the 1000s while `wday` is limited to a max of 6). For algorithms that use a distance metric to make predictions, such as support vector machine or K-nearest neighbors, features that have vastly different ranges can prevent learning. Feature scaling is done on a per-feature (each column) basis to ensure consistent feature ranges across the dataset. There are two methods for feature scaling:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scaling to a range: transform each feature to a specified range. For a range of 0 to 1, this is done using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x' = \\frac{x - \\text{min}(x)}{\\text{max}(x)-\\text{min}(x)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Standardization: subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. This ensures all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is done with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x' = \\frac{x - \\bar{x}}{\\sigma}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Equations source from [Wikipedia: Feature Scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_scaling)\n",
    "\n",

The scaler must be `fit` (trained or in other words, learn the ranges) on the training data and then `transform` both the training and testing data."

    "1. Replace the `NaN` values in `sun_rise_set` with `neither`.\n",
    "2. Convert the `timestamp` into a datetime object and extract the `yday`, `month`, `wday`.\n",
    "3. Transform the cyclical variables into a cyclical representation and remove the ordered time variables.\n",
    "4. Encode the categorical variables: one-hot encoding for `sun_rise_set` and label encoding for `week_day_end`.\n",
    "5. Select the observations where energy consumption is non-zero and select the targets and remove the columns that cannot be used for learning.\n",
    "6. Separate the data into training and testing features and targets.\n",
    "7. Scale the features to a range between 0 and 1 by fitting on the training data.\n",
    "8. Check for missing values.\n",

    "[Refactoring code into functions is a crucial step](https://bids.berkeley.edu/news/joy-code-refactoring) in reproducible data science. Taking individual steps and putting them into a function allows the code to be re-used and produce the same results every time. Our function will include a [doc string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docstring) that tells us the purpose, the parameters, and the return values so others (and our future selves) can use the function again and modify if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function will take in a building energy dataframe, a number of testing days, and a flag for whether the features should be scaled. It will return a training set of features, training targets, a testing set of features, and testing targets. These features and targets can then be used for training, prediction, and evaluation of any standard machine learning algorithm."

The results can be used for training a model, making predictions with the model, and evaluating the model's performance. In later notebooks we will build these models, train them, assess their performance on the test data, and select the best model for further development. The effort done here will be the foundation upon which the rest of the the work relies. "
